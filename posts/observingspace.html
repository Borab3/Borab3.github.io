   <div class="b">
      <p>i spent about 45 minuites exploring a concrete space alongside my apartment complex.</p>
      <p>as this concrete strip is mostly used by students going to and from school and the apartments, there were many people with backpacks and other school supplies.</p>
      <h4>movement throught the space</h4>
      <p>many people moved through the space on foot. some also used bikes for faster transportation. occasionally there were some skateboarders or other forms of rolling movement, but for the most part, people on foot were the norm.</p>
      <h4>barriers in the space</h4>
      <p>as the concrete was on the north side of the building, there was ice and snow on the strip for longer than on other sidewalks. i once saw a cycleist fall on the ice. there is limited traffic so there is not much in way of traffic that clogs the space, however there are sometimes small groups that make navigation difficult.</p>
      <h4>unused space</h4>
      <p>the north border of the strip is a fence, but the south border is a dirt buffer between the strip and the building. there is no development on the dirt, and it is only used when a single traveler moves to the side to allow a group to pass. otherwise, there are some small bushes planted in the dirt, although they barely cover the dirt area, leaving the margin of land disused.</p>
     <h4>play/connectivity</h4>
     <p>when i was learning to skateboard, i used the concrete strip as a starting place. it is away from the street and empty most of the time. in terms of play, one could use the strip for games like hopscotch or other thin, long games. the strip is too thin to be used as a basketball court or street hockey strip. i think the best use, besides a walkway, would be for enjoying wheeled transport.</p>
     <h4>conclusion</h4>
     <p>as it stands now, the concrete strip is more of a glorified alleyway than a positive aspect of the area. while it is used every day, there is much untapped potential in the space, although one must be careful when concidering changing the area, as it is used every day by many students on their way to or from school.</p>
