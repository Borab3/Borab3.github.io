      <p>Triangle, Circle, Square, Hexagon and Trapezoid are a tight-knit club of con artists united in theft since high school. This time, though, the group of swindlers have graduated to the big-leagues with plans to take on Sin City. Although their sophisticated casino robbery seems to be spinning smoother than a Bellagio slot machine at first, the team starts to suspect Circle, who's actually the largest shareholder in casino insurance companies. Circle reveals his secret mid-heist, but the crew's fate is just as iffy as a game of roulette. </p>

      <p>The white space in the poster is desiged to show movement of the falling chips. The monochromatic color scheme and the font of the title "Highball" keys one into the time period the movie is set in, and the themes of gambiling and lavish lifestyles that are key to the plot. The circlular shape of the falling chips also connects to the name of the main character.
