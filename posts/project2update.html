      <h5>game table</h5>
      <p>for our project, we wanted to bring play to campus. to accomplish this, we chose to create a game table, and place it in an area where people sit to eat or do work. the inspiration behind this was a coffee shop in boulder that had cards and other games at the table for people to play while they wait. this experience greatly changed how i view current areas that leave their tables bare.</p>
      <p>for the table itself, we are planning to use an old desk and paint a chessboard and backgammon board on the top. in the shelves are common game peices and decks of cards, including instructions on how to play some of the more common games. additionally, there may be some strange games for those who are intersted in a new game playing experience. adorning the table will be text that will encourage those sitting at the table to invite other participants to play.</p>
      <p>one of the main challenges we are expecting to face is one of placement. we need to find an area that allows talking and conversation while still being a place where people go to sit for longer periods of time.</p>
      <p>our biggest hope is that people will find joy in the games, and make friends or at least iteract with the people around them. we would like for this game table to create community in the space, and provide contact with people who may sit in the same space as eachother, but never interact.</p>
