      <h4>game table</h4>
      <h6>purpose</h6>
      <p>we wanted to bring play to everyone. we noticed that, on campus, no one interacts with eachother, even when they are in close proximity. we wanted to give a chance for there to be community and fun especially when we are all stressed from the challenges of school and finals.</p>
      <h6>solution</h6>
      <p>to this end, we build a game table and placed it in the norlin library for those who study there to interact with. we had hoped that others would find enjoyment playing the games and would meet new people or destress. it was critical for us to include enough games that everyone who wanted to play could do so without unfamiliarity, and challenging enough games that the more adventurous could try something new.</p>
      <h6>process</h6>
      <p>building the game table too two steps. step one was finding the games. we carefully chose games that would not be too distracting or loud. we also understood that we were working under a budget, and therfore needed few versitle games as that was more feasible than many expensive but unique games. we also prefered intelectual games over those more luck based, as we felt that this was a better representation of the space. finally, we made sure that the game we bought needed to be played by two people to encourage community building and player connections.</p>
      <p>the second step was building the table itself. we purchased a desk with a drawer to store the games, and used tape and wood stain to create a chess or checkers board on the top. we believe that this checkerboard patter would be instantly recognisable as a place of play and interaction.</p>
      <h6>results</h6>
      <p>we had some difficuty getting results at first. most of the students at norlin were busy studying for classes, and did not have time to participate. when we approached people and offered to play, we were met with similar reactions. after time, however, we noticed that some students did play at the table, although far fewer than we expected. the day after we installed the table, we returned to make sure all the pieces were still there, and we noticed that the card game uno was in a different state than we had left it.</p>
      <p>we plan on leaving the game table in norlin until it is removed. we hope that it stays where it is, although we have reservations on the goodeness of people's hearts and worries that others will not respect the games in such a way that it becomes impossible to play at the table. if the game table is still intact in the future, i look foward to returning to it for another round of chess or battleship.</p>
