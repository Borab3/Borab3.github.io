      <h4>magical gatherings</h4>
      <p>recently i taught my girlfriend to play magic the gathering. a few months ago, wizards of the coast released magic arena, which is a free to play online version of the classic card game, which doubles as a great teaching tool and lets you learn to play and practice the mechanics without another person.</p>
      <p>after trying to give her too much direction, she instead requested to learn to play through the tutorial of the game. she kindly asked me to shut up, so at least now i can use it as reference material for this assignment.</p>
      <h4>rules</h4>
      <p>magic the gathering is a card game played by at least two player. each player has a deck with cards they chose from a total of over 18,000 unique different cards with different effects.</p>
      <p>cards are divided up by colors and types, with each having a different use and identitiy. the players start the game by deciding who goes first. the starting player then takes their turn.</p>
      <p>there are many actions and phases to a turn, but in general, a player draws a card from their deck, and then plays a land card which acts as resources to cast other cards in their hand. the ultimate goal of the game is to decrease the opponents life points to zero.</p>
      <h4>purpose of the game</h4>
      <p>the game is ultimately a test of skill and strategy. the first test comes from choosing the cards that make up your deck, focusing on the interactions between the various cards at ones disposal. the other challenge is the act of playing the game itself. interactions between your opponents cards and yours provides a challenge to beat your opponent before he or she beats you.</p>
      <p>this ability to build a deck of your design and use it to establish dominance over an opponent who has done the same is very rewarding. the elements of luck due to decks being randomized before the game creates a feel of replayability.</p>
      <p>ultimately, fun is subjective, but enough people find it fun to make magic the gatering the most successful trading card game to date</p>
      <h4>active play</h4>
      <p>one of the unique elements that make magic the gathering special is the lack of passive play. almost every action in the game a player, the opponent can respond in various ways. in general, turns are fast enough to remove too much downtime, and in competitive magic the gathering tournaments, one can be penalized for 'slow play'</p>
      <p>there are obviously more actions a player can take during their turn, but the game encourages players to add cards into their deck that can interact with their opponent on their turn, which helps elimiate downtime.</p>
      <h4>other observations</h4>
      <p>my girlfriend is not very good at magic the gathering</p>
