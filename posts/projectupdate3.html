      <p>the first step we took our game table was within the table itself. we started by searching for a sutable table that has drawers and enough space for at lest two players to comfortably sit at. we wanted to truly integrate the game aspect into the table, so we decided to paint or stain the table in the shape of a chess board. while it would be easier to glue the chessboard to the table, the dissonance in the aesthetics could hurt our chances for people to interact with the table. </p>
      <p>our second concideration was the games. we wanted the games to be accessable, while still new and fun. we stayed away from loud messy games like jenga or games that take too much time, like monopoly. we also wanted a variety, so that those who choose to play at our game table could have a new experience</p>
      <p>the final concideration was the accessability. we wanted to ensure that we could get people to come and play at our table. therefore, we need a combination of two things: 1)advertising. without a sign or poster detailing what the game table is about, no one would know. and 2) instruction. it is critical that users know what the play table is all about, and what is expected of them. we want to stress that anyone can come and play at our table, and if you do happen to sit at the table, you should invite others to play.</p>
      <p>we have made progress in our poject, but there is much left to do.</p>
