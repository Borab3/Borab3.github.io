      <h5>role</h5>
      <p>observe jim. jim is a hardworking family man, but moonlights as an experimental conspiracy theorist. among trying to disprove the round earth theory, he also avidly wants to experience a probing first hand. thanks to 'bovine intervention' (pattent pending), he finally can.</p>

      <h5>prototype</h5>
      <p>the 'bovine intervention' is designed to give maxium cow patterns to the user. note how it even comes complete with udders for true camouflage.</p>
    <p>after meeting with some fellow designers, we all agreed that there is a huge untapped market for the bovine intervention. some suggestions incuded marketing the bovine intervention as a way to excape the undesirable aspects of life, be it a stressful meeting, a rough family event, or even this class.</p>
    <p>we hope you are as excited about 'bovine intervention' as we are.</p>
