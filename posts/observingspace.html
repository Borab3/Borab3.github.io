      <p>i spent about 45 minuites exploring a concrete space alongside my apartment complex.</p>
      <p>as this concrete strip is mostly used by students going to and from school and the apartments, there were many people with backpacks and other school supplies.</p>
      <h4>movement throught the space</h4>
      <p>many people moved through the space on foot. some also used bikes for faster transportation. occasionally there were some skateboarders or other forms of rolling movement, but for the most part, people on foot were the norm.</p>
      <h4>barriers in the space</h4>
      <p>as the concrete was on the north side of the building, there was ice and snow on the strip for longer than on other sidewalks. i once saw a cycleist fall on the ice. there is limited traffic so there is not much in way of traffic that clogs the space, however there are sometimes small groups that make navigation difficult.</p>
